                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Iâ€™m Amrita Lakshmi Sabaridas, a B.Tech student in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. Driven by a passion for creating impactful technological solutions</p>
                    <p>My project, "Speak and Read," encompasses two core functionalities:</p>
                    <p># Speech-to-Text: This feature listens to user speech and converts it into text. It enables real-time transcription of spoken words, which is particularly useful for users who need assistance with communication or documentation.</p>
                    <p># Text-to-Speech: This feature takes written text and reads it aloud. It provides an auditory version of text, making it easier for users who are visually impaired or prefer listening over reading.</p>
                    <p>The goal of "Speak and Read" is to make communication more accessible and intuitive for everyone. </p>
